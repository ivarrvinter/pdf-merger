# PDF Merger

This Python code allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file. The code utilizes the PyPDF2 library and PyQt5 framework to provide a user-friendly interface for selecting the PDF files.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- PyPDF2
- PyQt5

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```pythom
pip install PyPDF2 PyQt5
```

## Usage

To merge PDF files, follow these steps:

1. Run the code by executing the Python script.

2. A file dialog window will appear, allowing you to select multiple PDF files to merge. Navigate to the desired folder and select the PDF files.

3. Click the "Open" or "OK" button in the file dialog window to confirm the file selection.

4. The code will merge the selected PDF files into a single PDF file named "merged.pdf".

5. Once the merging process is complete, you will find the merged PDF file in the same directory as the Python script.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your specific requirements.
